#  Train Animation using C++ Graphics

This project is a fun and creative train animation made using **C++** and the **graphics.h** library. The main idea was to explore basic computer graphics concepts and create a visually appealing scene where a train moves across a natural landscape.

---

##  What this project includes
- A moving train with engine, coaches and rotating wheels
- Smoke animation coming out of the engine
- A nature environment including:
  - Sun
  - Trees
  - Grass and scattered pebbles
- Optional rain effect for a more dynamic look

The animation keeps running smoothly to give the feeling of motion.

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C++**
- Graphics Library: **graphics.h** (BGI graphics)
- Any IDE that supports graphics (Turbo C++ / CodeBlocks + WinBGIm setup)

---

## How to Run
1. Install WinBGIm graphics library or use an IDE that supports `graphics.h`
2. Add the required BGI files into the correct folder (usually `BGI/`)
3. Compile and run the `train_animation.cpp` file

If everything is set up correctly, the animation will start automatically.

##  What I Learned
Working on this project helped me understand:
- How shapes are drawn using C++ graphics functions
- Basics of animation using frame updates
- Use of delays and coordinate changes for motion
- Structuring scenes and objects visually

## Note
This project is made for learning and academic purposes.  
Feel free to try it, modify it, and have fun with graphics!
